- `/app/projects/Fataer/page.jsx`
- `/app/projects/Center/page.jsx`
- `/app/projects/Nadi/page.jsx`

**Recommended Actions**:
- Create a `ProjectDetail` component for consistent project page layouts
- Extract project content sections into reusable components
- Add image galleries, testimonial sections, and progress indicators

### 2. Blog Detail Pages
Individual blog post pages in `/app/blogs/[slug]/` need unification.

**Pages to Update**:
- `/app/blogs/[slug]/page.jsx`

**Recommended Actions**:
- Create a `BlogDetail` component for consistent blog post layouts
- Extract author bio, related posts, and sharing components
- Add reading progress indicators and table of contents

### 3. Admin Pages
Several admin pages still use mixed styling approaches.

**Pages to Update**:
- `/app/admin/blogs/page.jsx`
- `/app/admin/messages/page.jsx`
- `/app/admin/settings/page.jsx`

**Recommended Actions**:
- Create admin-specific components (AdminTable, AdminForm, etc.)
- Unify admin layout and navigation patterns
- Add bulk actions and filtering components

### 4. Missing Assets
Several pages reference images that may not exist in the public directory.

**Missing Assets**:
- `/images/community.jpg` (used in projects page)
- `/images/village.jpg` (used in projects page)
- `/partners/partner[1-4].png` (used in about page)
- Project-specific images referenced in data

**Recommended Actions**:
- Add placeholder images or update references
- Implement proper image optimization and fallbacks
- Add image alt text for accessibility

### 5. Form Validation Enhancement
Contact forms could benefit from more advanced validation.

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
- Real-time validation feedback
- Moroccan phone number format validation
- File upload capabilities for donation forms
- Multi-step form wizard for complex submissions

### 6. Performance Optimizations
Several optimization opportunities identified.

**Performance Tasks**:
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Add skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
- Optimize image sizes and formats
- Implement code splitting for large pages

### 7. Accessibility Enhancements
While basic accessibility is implemented, some enhancements could be added.

**A11y Improvements**:
- Add skip navigation links
- Implement high contrast mode support
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Improve focus management in complex interactions

## Design System Gaps

### 1. Color Variations
The design system could benefit from additional color variants.

**Missing Variants**:
- Warning/amber color for alerts
- Neutral color variants for subtle elements
- Dark mode color palette (for future implementation)

### 2. Component Variants
Some components could use additional variants.

**Component Enhancements**:
- Button: "link" variant for text buttons
- Card: "minimal" variant for subtle cards

### 3. Animation Library
Consider adding framer-motion for more advanced animations.

**Animation Enhancements**:
- Page transition animations
- Stagger animations for lists
- Parallax effects for hero sections
- Advanced hover interactions

## Technical Debt

### 1. Component Dependencies
Some components have external dependencies that could be optimized.

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Audit bundle size impact of Radix UI components
- Consider lighter alternatives for simple use cases
- Implement tree shaking for unused component variants

### 2. CSS Organization
Global CSS could be better organized.

**Organization Tasks**:
- Move component-specific styles to CSS modules
- Create theme-specific CSS files
- Implement CSS custom properties more extensively

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Internationalization
Prepare for Arabic language support.

**I18n Preparation**:
- Extract all text strings for translation
- Implement RTL layout support
- Add locale-specific formatting (dates, numbers, currency)

### 2. Advanced Features
Consider advanced functionality for better UX.

**Feature Ideas**:
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Offline functionality for forms
- Push notifications for updates
- Advanced search and filtering

### 3. Analytics Integration
Add analytics and user behavior tracking.

**Analytics Tasks**:
- Implement Google Analytics or similar
- Add conversion tracking for donations
- Implement heat mapping for UX insights
- Add A/B testing capabilities

## Build & Deployment Issues

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are documented.

**Documentation Tasks**:
- Document all environment variables in README
- Add validation for required variables
- Provide example .env files

### 2. Database Migrations
Document database schema and migration procedures.

**Database Tasks**:
- Document all database tables and relationships
- Create migration scripts for schema changes
